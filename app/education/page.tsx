          Education has always been the cornerstone of my journey into the tech
          world. Pursuing an engineering degree in Software Engineering at Sup'Com
          , has provided me a strong foundation in computer science and software development.

        <PageHeaderDescription>
          My journey in tech started with a Bachelor’s degree at ISET Rades, where I graduated as major of my promotion. Building on this strong foundation, I continued my studies at SUP’COM, further deepening my knowledge and practical skills in software engineering.
